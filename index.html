    <p>To continue the further investigation it is necessary to define what do we mean by future. Of course the most obvious answer would refer to the moment following after the present one, which leads us to the temporal perception of future. We can also think of it from the spacial point of view, as places we’ve not discovered or created yet. But for the current discussion the most relevant way to look at the future is mythological. Unlike the previous two, it describes the future not as a linear system, but as a cultural phenomena. “Future is not a natural dimension of the mind, rather it is a modality of perception and imagination…” (after the future) In this sense by future we mean progress, development, growth, but also an achievement of the ultimate goal at the end of the way.
      Most of the modern political theories such as liberalism, social democracy, nationalism and communism are built on the same ground, defined by imperfection of present and brightness of upcoming.
