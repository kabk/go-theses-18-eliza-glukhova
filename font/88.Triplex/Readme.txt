About this version
------------------

This is an homemade conversion from the Emigre Triplex Type 1 fonts to an OpenType version for the PC and the Mac. The contents of the old style figures fonts has been integrated as OpenType features in the main fonts - then, in the OpenType-aware applications (such as InDesign or XPress 7), you need only to install these main fonts. The OpenType-blind applications (such as MS Word) are seeing the OpenType fonts as ordinary Type 1 fonts: to get old style figures in these applications, you must install the fonts which are in the "For the OT-blind applications" folder.

Well, Triplex is'nt a new font, you know. But I find it always young, it's the Helvetica's annoyance killer. When the life is becoming tedious, look at the "g" in Triplex, it will send you a smile - and you will open the vodka bottle a little later.

NB 1: there isn't any italic style in Triplex, because italic isn't a style here, it's a family, one of the three families.
NB 2: you are not allowed to protest against the quotes in Triplex and the other Zuzana Licko's fonts. That's the Zuzana Licko's quotes - a good and genuine race of quotes (and if you are really too old to change your habits, you will find reversed quotes added by me in some of the fonts).

Emigre about Triplex
--------------------

Although initially designed as a rational/geometric font, Triplex developed into one of Licko's most intuitive typeface designs at the time. It's first extensive use was in Emigre magazine #14, a special issue devoted to Swiss designers. 

Triplex was intended as a friendly substitute for Helvetica. The name Triplex refers to the three versions that make up the entire family; Triplex, Triplex Serif and Triplex Italic. Each version of the typeface comes in light, bold and extra bold. The italic was designed and drawn by type designer and sign painter John Downer, and was designed to work with both the serif and sans serif versions.
